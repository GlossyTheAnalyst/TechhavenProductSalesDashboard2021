* Prioritize marketing efforts in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City, where returns are highest.
### 3. Target Emerging Markets:
* Analyze customer behavior in cities like Atlanta and Dallas to identify barriers to sales and improve outreach.
### 4. Seasonal Campaigns:
* Capitalize on end-of-year sales trends by planning promotions and product launches during October to December.
### 5. Bundle Offers:
